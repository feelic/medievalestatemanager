Medieval Estate Manager 2015
=====================

Medieval Estate Manager 2015 is a video game about cabbage, mud and dying of the flu.


It is inspired from 
* Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings II
* Impressions Games' Lords of the Realm II
* Amit Patel's fantastic work on procedural map generation with voronoi diagrams ( http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/ )

It uses libraries 
* Raymond Hill Voronoi JS ( http://www.raymondhill.net/voronoi/rhill-voronoi.html )
